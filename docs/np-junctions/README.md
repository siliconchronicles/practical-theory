# Practical Diodes and NP Junctions

This video describes the theory of NP junctions, which are the key components of both diodes and bipolar transistors.

The video contains a few demos that you may want to build by yourself. The lists of components for each mini-project are below:

### What materials you'll need

You will need a powered breadboard (a power supply with 3.3V or 5V will work perfectly. You can use a 9V battery with some special care described below). You will also need

* 5 × identical diodes. My demo uses 1N4148, but you can use other kind. Readily available options are 1N4001 to 1N4007. You could even use LEDs (use the same kind of LED)
* 5 × different resistors. All of them should be at least 220Ω (use 470Ω if you use a 9V battery). In my demo, I used the following values:
  * 220Ω
  * 1KΩ
  * 2KΩ
  * 5.1KΩ
  * 10KΩ
* A multimeter
