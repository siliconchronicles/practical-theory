# Practical Theory

I've collected here some resources about my "practical theory" series of videos, where I try to explain a bit of theory but trying
to never get into the kind of "pure theory" explanations that are built on examples that you very rarely encounter in practice.
Instead, I try to give the theory you need to solve the problems you'll face as a beginner.
